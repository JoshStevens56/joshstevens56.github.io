### Installation

The following frameworks and ecosystems are needed for this project:

#### - Anaconda

1. Go to <https://www.anaconda.com/>
2. Download and Install Anaconda
3. Create a separate virtual environment for anaconda install (i.e. 'Personal Website')
4. Add node.js to environment packages

#### - Numpy

1. Open the command prompt
2. (Optional) Use the following command to validate the virtual environment has been properly created"

        conda info --envs

3. Active the virtual environment:

        conda activate [environment name]
4. Install numpy with the following command:

        conda install numpy

#### - React and Material UI

1. Open command prompt and activate anaconda environment.
2. Navigate to the repo folder in command prompt
3. Run

        npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

4. Run:

        npm install react react-dom
5. Run:

        npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

*Refer to the following resources for additional guidance and context:*

- [react app install via vscode](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial>)
- [material ui installation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- [numpy installation](<https://numpy.org/install/>)

## Backend

Platform to run the API requests from.
Will be responsible for fetching data from the db based on requests from the front end, and potentially communicating with 3rd party APIs.

Expected to be hosted in AWS using the Lambda free 1,000,000 requests per month offering.
